# ImagePixelSorter
This Java program sorts the pixels of an image based on brightness value by implementing a 2D Bubble Sort algorithm. The sorting technique used in this program is an adaptation of Bubble Sort to 2D matrices. The sort is called by a timer repeatedly to visualize the pixel sorting process.
